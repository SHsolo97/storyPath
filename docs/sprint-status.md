# Sprint 1â€“2 status

Done

- Schema + validator; sample story
- Architecture and analytics docs (analytics taxonomy, tracking plan, SDK integration plan)
- Backend scaffolding: gateway, content, progress services; docker-compose for Postgres; Prisma schema and migrations wired
- Repo config: .editorconfig, .gitignore, ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit with validator and lint-staged
- Mobile app init (Expo) with navigation, API fetch, dark mode, and local storage foundation (AsyncStorage)

Notes

- CI validates schema and typechecks backend services; mobile TS checks are deferred to runtime builds to avoid RN type noise in CI.
